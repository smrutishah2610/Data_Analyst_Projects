# ABC Company IT Dashboard Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive IT Dashboard for ABC Company using Power BI. The dashboard was designed to monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for the IT department's efficiency and reliability. Simulated data was used to build a star-schema data model to support efficient and effective analysis.

## Key Features
### Dashboard Highlights
The dashboard focuses on the following metrics:
- **IT Operations**: Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), system uptime, and incident volume to assess issue resolution and reliability.
- **Cybersecurity**: Threat response times, security incidents, and vulnerabilities to ensure safety and compliance.
- **Network & Cloud**: Network downtime, server usage, latency, and cloud costs for reliability and cost optimization.
- **Software Development**: Deployment frequency, bug resolution times, and feature delivery rates to enhance software quality.

### Insights and Analysis
1. **Incident Management**:
   - Identified high MTTR during certain months.
   - Recommended solutions: enhanced training, better documentation, and automated alert systems.

2. **System Uptime**:
   - Observed lower uptime on weekends and holidays.
   - Suggested implementing automated monitoring and workload redistribution.

3. **Network Congestion**:
   - Found high latency during peak hours.
   - Proposed load balancing and increasing network capacity.

4. **Cybersecurity**:
   - Noticed recurring vulnerabilities.
   - Recommended regular security training and patch updates.

## Why Power BI?
Power BI was chosen due to its:
- **Ease of Use**: User-friendly interface suitable for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Ability to connect with multiple data sources like AWS CloudWatch and ServiceNow.
- **Visualization Power**: Advanced features for creating interactive and insightful dashboards.
- **Data Modeling**: Robust support for creating star schema models for efficient querying.

Despite its advantages, Power BI requires a license and some technical expertise for advanced customizations.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Getting Started**:
   - Open the Power BI file (`ITDepartment.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
   - Ensure the required data sources are accessible.

2. **Interacting with the Dashboard**:
   - Use filters to refine data by time range, incident type, or system ID.
   - Hover over visuals for detailed tooltips and insights.
   - Utilize cross-filtering to explore relationships between metrics.

3. **Exporting Data**:
   - Right-click on visuals to export data for further analysis in tools like Excel.

## Skills Gained
Through this project, the following skills were developed:
- **Data Visualization**: Transforming complex datasets into intuitive visuals.
- **Cross-Department Insights**: Gaining a holistic view of IT's impact on organizational performance.
- **Dashboard Design**: Crafting user-friendly and actionable dashboards for diverse stakeholders.

## Files Included
- **ITDepartment.pbix**: Power BI dashboard file.
- **amazon_kpi_star_schema_corrected.xlsx**: The star schema model for data organization.
- **Testing_Report_Smruti_Shah_IT_Department.pdf**: Detailed testing report.
- **AbcITDashboardDemo.mov**: Video demonstration of the dashboard.
